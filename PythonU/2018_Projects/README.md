There are two projects in this directory

Firstly is a Data Structures and Algorithms. 
Project was designed to show case Data Structures and Algorithms understanding, no inbuilt lists or dictionaries were allowed. 
In Part 3 (margin), dictionaries were used as my hash tables were not fully functioning.

Secondly is a project based on Computer Simulation. 
This project was concerned at looking at spurious regressions between the UK Money Demand, Perth Rainfall and US GDP and resimulating the values to what was assumed to be their respective distributions.
